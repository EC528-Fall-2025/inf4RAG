# Optimizing Cloud-Based Inference for RAG and Agentic Workloads

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing cloud-based inference for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and agentic workloads. We will explore how modern AI inference workloads can be efficiently served using cloud-native infrastructure, evaluating different components including model serving frameworks, orchestration layers, caching strategies, and GPU/accelerator utilization. The key objective is to identify performance and cost trade-offs when deploying these systems on major cloud platforms.

## 1. Vision and Goals Of The Project:

Our vision is to design and optimize a scalable cloud-based inference stack that enables efficient deployment of modern large language model (LLM) workloads, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic applications. The project will demonstrate how end-to-end inference workflows can be deployed on heterogeneous cloud infrastructure, leveraging CPUs and accelerators (e.g., GPUs or Intel Gaudi), and orchestrated through Kubernetes. By doing so, we aim to establish best practices that balance performance, cost, and scalability when deploying AI systems in real-world cloud environments. The culmination of this work will be a comprehensive benchmarking report that documents our findings, performance trade-offs, and recommended practices for future deployments.

**High-Level Goals**:
- End-to-End Inference Flow: Build and deploy a complete inference pipeline that supports both simple chatbot interactions and more advanced agentic use cases (e.g., automating domain-specific tasks).
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implement RAG pipelines that enhance inference by incorporating external, domain-specific data at query time, improving relevance and adaptability of outputs.
- Inference Stack Optimization: Evaluate model serving frameworks such as vLLM and orchestration tools like llm-d, focusing on latency, throughput, and cost trade-offs.
- Deployment on Cloud Infrastructure: Containerize and manage the inference stack within a Kubernetes cluster, enabling reproducible, scalable deployments.
- Benchmarking and Best Practices: Develop a standardized benchmarking suite to compare configurations, analyze results, and compile findings into a final report.

Stretch Goals: 
- Heterogeneous Scheduling: Explore strategies for efficiently distributing workloads across CPUs and accelerators, identifying where GPU offloading provides the most performance benefit.

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:
This project is designed for technical professionals who deploy, optimize, and maintain AI inference systems, as well as stakeholders who depend on benchmarking insights to guide research or business decisions.

**Primary Users**:
- ML Engineers: Deploy and optimize LLM inference systems in production environments. They require tools to evaluate latency, throughput, and efficiency across different configurations.
- Cloud Architects: Design and manage scalable cloud infrastructure. They are focused on heterogeneous scheduling, balancing workloads between CPUs and accelerators, and optimizing cost-performance trade-offs.
- DevOps Engineers: Maintain the reliability, scalability, and observability of deployed inference systems. They require containerized deployments, CI/CD integration, and monitoring for system health.

**Secondary Users**:
- Research Teams: Conduct experiments to measure LLM performance, reproducibility, and efficiency across hardware and inference stacks. Their focus is on generating insights rather than maintaining production deployments.
- Product Managers: Use benchmarking results to make infrastructure investment decisions. They are interested in high-level cost, performance, and scalability trade-offs rather than implementation details.

## 3. Scope and Features Of The Project:

**In Scope**:
- **Support various LLM inference tasks** (e.g., text generation and question answering).
- **Organize modern LLM workloads** (Agentic tasks, RAG workflows) and experiment with different configurations
  -  Core inference engine built with vLLM
  - Tweak inference parameters in prebuilt models to improve performance
  - Execute in cloud native environments
 - **Craft a benchmarking suite** that can measure the key performance of our system
    - Report metrics (throughput, latency, cost-efficiency, resource utilization, etc.)
    - Evaluate different components of the inference stack (orchestration layers, caching strategies, and GPU/accelerator utilization, etc.)
- **Compare the performance of different inference stack configurations** and highlight best practices for scalability and deployment


**Out of scope**:
- Configure and execute LLM-based inference stacks in non-cloud environments
- Training and fine-tuning LLMs (existing models will be used instead) 
- Long-term production deployment and monitoring


## 4. Solution Concept

### Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:
This project mainly includes two parts: serving and benchmarking.

For serving, this project adopts Kubernetes to manage and organize computing and storage resources, where vLLM, as the core of high-performance LLM inference that empowers various upper-level applications, such as text generation and workflows, can be deployed on different nodes along with facilities for agentic workflow, like Cloud-native vector database. Additionally, common mechanisms like load balance, fault tolerance, and dynamic scaling can be supported if resources allow.
As for the benchmarking, this project includes a benchmark suite that can test different metrics (e.g., Throughput, TTFT, and TPOT) under different scenarios with adjustable payloads.

The architecture follows a phased approach with four distinct phases:

**Phase 1: vLLM** - Basic vLLM setup for LLM inference

**Phase 2: RAG System (+ Vector DB)** - Integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation system with Vector Database

**Phase 3: Caching (+ Redis Cache)** - Incorporation of caching using Redis

**Phase 4: Agentic (+ Orchestration + MCP Server + Heterogeneous Scheduling)** - Addition of agentic capabilities with MCP server and intelligent GPU/CPU task routing

The system includes request processing layer (Load Balancer, API Gateway, Task Classifier, Heterogeneous Scheduler), core inference engine (vLLM Engine, Model Registry), RAG system (Document Processor, Embedding Model, Vector Database, Retrieval Engine), agentic system (MCP Server, Orchestrator, Agentic Workflows), caching layer (Embedding Cache, Query Cache, Response Cache), and infrastructure resources (GPU Nodes, CPU Nodes, Object Storage).

### Design Implications and Discussion:

To accommodate cloud computing, all components in the serving part can be distributed. With proper configurations, the system could have high availability and be robust to the single point of failure (SPOF). At the same time, it also allows the dynamic scaling just in case the computing resource runs out.
