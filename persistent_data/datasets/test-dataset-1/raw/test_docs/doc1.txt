Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
