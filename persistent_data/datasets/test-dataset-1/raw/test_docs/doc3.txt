Deep learning is an AI function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. This technique has revolutionized the field of machine learning by providing the ability to automatically learn representations from data.
