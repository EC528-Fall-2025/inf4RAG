Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding. It combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.
